BBH demo crashes, pointing to "bhv_exclamation_box_loop" - Update: This has now moved to the CCM demo, and is console only.
Grabbing bowser activates the far camera, maybe the one as if he was already thrown
BBH falling bridge room needs BG drawn - am actually surprised that was a problem
CCM slide precision issues
Goddard screen completely fails to load on iQue, have to skip it entirely to not crash the game. And naturally, it works fine on N64.
Revisit throwmatrix implementation
