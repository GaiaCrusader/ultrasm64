/**
 * Behavior for bhvUnusedPoundablePlatform.
 *
 * This unused behavior controls a platform that shatters into small triangles
 * if Mario ground pounds it.
 *
 * Its collision model perfectly aligns with the hole leading to In the
 * Deep Freeze in Snowman's Land. It is likely that players early in development
 * would have to ground pound this platform before being able to access the star.
 *
 * Curiously, the triangles spawned when the platform breaks use a model that
 * is not used anywhere else.
